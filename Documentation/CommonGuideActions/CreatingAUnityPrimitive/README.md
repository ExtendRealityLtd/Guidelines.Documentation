# Creating A Unity Primitive

## Text Example

```
Create a new `<Primitive Type>` Unity 3D Object by selecting `Main Menu -> GameObject -> 3D Object -> <Primitive Type>` and change the Transform properties to:

<Only list Transform Properties that will change.>

* Position: `X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 0`
* Rotation: `X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 0`
* Scale: `X = 1, Y = 1, Z = 1`

Rename the new `<Primitive Type>` to `<Name Required>`.
```

Create a new `Cube` Unity 3D Object by selecting `Main Menu -> GameObject -> 3D Object -> Cube` and change the Transform properties to:

* Position: `X = 1, Y = 0, Z = 1`
* Scale: `X = 2, Y = 2, Z = 2`

Rename the new `Cube` to `Table`.
